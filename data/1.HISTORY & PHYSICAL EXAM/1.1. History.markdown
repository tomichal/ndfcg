**1. History**

1. Should be able to efficiently obtain a complete relevant and organized neurologic and infectious history including acuity of symptom onset, review of neurologic and systemic symptoms, prior diagnostic testing and treatment  
2. Should be able to perform a thorough assessment of risk factors for infection

   3. Understands and screens appropriately for social factors that may increase risk of infection  
      1. Homelessness  
      2. Incarceration  
      3. IV drug use  
      4. Living conditions increasing risk of fecal oral transmission (lack of running water, plumbing)  
         1. Particularly important to understand that this is the major risk for neurocysticercosis (common misconception that it is from eating raw pork)  
      5. Zoonotic exposures  
         1. Arthropods  
            1. Mosquitoes  
            2. Ticks  
         2. Other zoonotic exposures  
            1. Bats, dogs (Rabies)  
            2. Rodents (Leptospirosis, LCMV, Monkeypox, Hantavirus, Tularemia)  
            3. Cats especially kittens (Bartonella)  
      6. Dietary exposures  
         1. Listeria-specific exposures: unpasteurized dairy, deli meats, those with current outbreaks, [recalls](https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts)   
         2. Host risk factors
    4. Understands and screens patient for the varied causes of altered immunocompetence and understands the specific risks associated with each

         2. Genetic immunodeficiency  
            1. X-linked agammaglobulinemia, IgA deficiency, CVID  
         3. Hematologic malignancies  
      2. Cellular immunodeficiency  
         1. HIV  
         2. Iatrogenic  
            1. Calcineurin inhibitors   
         3. Genetic  
            1. Examples: DigGeorge syndrome, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, hyper-immunoglobulin M syndrome  
         4. Hematologic malignancies  
      3. Combined B & T cell deficiencies  
         1. Iatrogenic:  
            1. Stem cell transplant

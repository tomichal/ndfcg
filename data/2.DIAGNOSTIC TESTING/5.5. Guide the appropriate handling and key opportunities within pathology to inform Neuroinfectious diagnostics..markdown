**5. Guide the appropriate handling and key opportunities within pathology to inform Neuroinfectious diagnostics.**

1. Indications for pathology  
2. Pathologic processing (ie making sure to get cultures, limitations when specimens are fixed, etc)  
3. What can be performed on tissue, what are common findings to suggest infection  
4. Interpreted reports not actual specimens (granulomas, vasculitis, infection-specific findings like Cowdry A bodies, etc)

**2. Neurophysiology**

1. Understand the indications for neurophysiological testing in the diagnostic work-up and management of neurological infections.  
2. Utilize the localization capabilities of neurophysiological testing to help identify possible infectious pathogens; examples include:  
   1. Temporal lobe discharges on EEG; consider HSV encephalitis  
   2. Nerve root localization on EMG/NCS; consider HSV, VZV, CMV, EBV radiculitis  
   3. Myositis on EMG; consider various infectious causes of myositis  
   4. Anterior horn localization on EMG/NCS; consider EV D68/A71, WNV

**1. Neuroimaging**

1. Be familiar with advantages and disadvantages of various imaging modalities for the diagnostic work-up of neurological infections including, but not limited to:  
   1. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain and spine  
   2. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, orbits, and spine  
   3. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with vessel wall imaging  
   4. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain  
   5. Positron emission tomography (PET) of brain and/or body  
2. Recognize imaging abnormalities associated with the following neuroinfectious syndromes and be able to list a differential diagnosis for each one:  
   1. Meningitis  
   2. Encephalitis  
   3. Rhombencephalitis  
   4. Infectious vasculitis  
   5. Optic neuritis  
   6. Brain abscess  
   7. Myelitis  
   8. Radiculitis/myeloradiculitis  
   9. Epidural abscess  
   10. Spondylodiscitis  
3. Recognize clinical syndromes and pathogens associated with the following imaging patterns:  
   1. Leptomeningitis  
   2. Pachymeningitis  
   3. Multi-focal brain lesions  
   4. Multi-focal brain infarcts  
   5. Ring-enhancing lesion(s)  
   6. Confluent white matter abnormalities  
   7. Longitudinally extensive cord signal abnormalities  
   8. Optic nerve abnormalities  
   9. Nerve root enhancement  
   10. Vessel wall enhancement  
4. Recognize unique imaging abnormalities associated with certain pathogens by utilizing knowledge of pathogen tropism; examples include, but are not limited to:  
   1. Temporal lobe– HSV, HHV6,  
   2. Deep gray nuclei– Flaviviruses, Powassan virus  
   3. White matter– JC virus, HIV  
   4. Cerebellum – WNV, VZV, Powassan virus  
   5. Brainstem – Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis  
   6. Anterior horns of spinal cord – Enterovirus D68/A71, WNV, polio virus  
   7. Dorsal column and corticospinal tract – Treponema pallidum, HTLV-1, HIV   
   8. Conus medullaris and cauda equina – HSV-2, VZV, Schistosoma  
   9. Nerve roots – HSV-2, CMV, HIV, EBV  
5. Understand the unique roles, advantages, and disadvantages of the following imaging modalities in the diagnostic work-up of neurological infections:  
   1. MRA vessel wall imaging – role in infectious vasculitis  
   2. MRI spectroscopy – role in differentiating infection (e.g. toxoplasmosis) from malignancy (e.g. CNS lymphoma)
